### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a physics student mainly interested in Theoretical Physics. I am also strongly focused on ML & DS, being one of the forunders of the Machine Learning Journal Club. Other than that, I explore classical computational methods and applications, mainly regarding physics problem.
On the ML side, I am more oriented towards a research-centric approach, partly because of my personal inclination and partly because I believe there is a lot more to be discovered about the workings of ML models (in particular NNs). 

  In general, I prefer working with relatively small models, making efficiency a costant presence in my efforts. In particular, I am very interested in Continual Learning and its application to real world problems, in particular the aspects regarding complex robot behaviuor in rela world environments and human-like learning capabilities.
  
  Despite I spend most of my efforts learning and researching, I think that it is also very important to make my skills more directly available to the non-academic world. This is the motivation behind my choice of being a Freelancer DS/ML "engineer". I collaborate(ed) with industries that operates in different fields and this provided me with interesting and useful insights of those application domains.
